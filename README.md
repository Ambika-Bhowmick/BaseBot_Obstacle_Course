# BaseBot_Obstacle_Course
Course description and obstacle details. 
Our robot travels in a circle for the obstacle course. Included in that circle is a ramp, cones, seesaw, tunnel and narrow walls for our robot to avoid, balance, and be precise while driving.

How your BaseBot interacts with each obstacle:
Our robot starts at the ramp and will have to climb up the ramp and make sure it has enough velocity to go over it. After, it will drive straight and will avoid cones by going through the gaps. The walls will allow the robot to be precise so that it doesn't hit it while driving through. Then the tunnel will allow the robot to go through it and it has bumps on the bottom to make it harder. Finally, the see saw acts as a moving balancing beam that allows to robot to go up and then down on the other side. 

How to run your Python script:
To run the Python script, you have to down load in to the brain by using a USB A - C. You will have to plug in the USB A part into your computer and C into the brain and wait for them to connect. After that, you will have to press run and the robot should start moving.

Reflection on what worked well and what challenges you faced:
The planning and the code were the easiest part to do. As coding was simple with things like going straight, turning and changing velocity. The testing was a bit hard as sometimes the robot would get really close to finishing it but it wouldn't do it completely. The hardest part was building the obstacles; especially the seesaw. We found it hard to make it balance and be stable. We also have a bit of trouble with the ramp as we had to make sure that the robot would have enough velocity to get over it. In the end, the was a fun project to do that made us think about coding and building!
